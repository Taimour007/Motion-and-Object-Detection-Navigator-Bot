### **Basic Working Setup:**

1. **Arduino Uno** processes data from the **PIR Motion Sensor** and **Ultrasonic Sensor**.
2. The **PIR Sensor** detects motion and triggers the system to start the **DC motors**.
3. The **Ultrasonic Sensor** continuously measures distance to obstacles, and if an obstacle is too close, it stops or re-directs the robot.
4. **Motor Driver** (e.g., L298N) controls the speed and direction of the motors based on the input from the Arduino.
